# Build a Kubernetes cluster using k3s via Ansible

Author: <https://github.com/itwars>

## K3s Ansible Playbook

Build a Kubernetes cluster using Ansible with k3s. The goal is easily install a Kubernetes cluster on machines running:

- [X] Debian
- [X] Ubuntu
- [X] CentOS

on processor architecture:

- [X] x64
- [X] arm64
- [X] armhf

## System requirements

Deployment environment must have Ansible 2.4.0+
Master and nodes must have passwordless SSH access

## Usage

First create a new directory based on the `sample` directory within the `inventory` directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp -R inventory/sample inventory/my-cluster
```

Second, edit `inventory/my-cluster/hosts.ini` to match the system information gathered above. For example:

```bash
[master]
192.16.35.12

[node]
192.16.35.[10:11]

[k3s_cluster:children]
master
node
```

If multiple hosts are in the master group, the playbook will automatically setup k3s in HA mode with etcd.

This requires at least k3s version 1.19.1

If needed, you can also edit `inventory/my-cluster/group_vars/all.yml` to match your environment.

Start provisioning of the cluster using the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml -i inventory/my-cluster/hosts.ini
```

## Kubeconfig

To get access to your **Kubernetes** cluster just

```bash
scp debian@master_ip:~/.kube/config ~/.kube/config
```
